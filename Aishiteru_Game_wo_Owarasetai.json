  "description": "Childhood friends who've been together since they were little. They both realize their feelings for each other, but they're too close to be honest. What connects them is the I Love You Game that they've been playing since they were little. The conclusion of their love is entrusted to this silly game, where you win if you make the other person embarrassed!\n\nOfficial Raw: https://www.sunday-webry.com/episode/3269754496654596722\nBookwalker: https://bookwalker.jp/series/349397/\nViz Manga: https://www.viz.com/vizmanga/chapters/i-want-to-end-this-love-game\nAmazon US: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8VXLGJ1\n\nChurch of Potteto Discord: https://discord.gg/pMZp9DTKBe",
